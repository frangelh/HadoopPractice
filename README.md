Revenues data Analysis using MAP REDUCE on a hadoop cluster.
For this task I developed a script to generate a Data set with 10k of random sales.
After I created a Mapper and Reducer to solve the analysis: 
  *Total Sales per Store
  *Total Sales per Month
  *Month with more sales
  *Store with more sales
